# Chemistr-AR-Unity
Chemistry AR project in unity to simulate chemical reactions

I made this project to help students to understand the chemical reactions and watch them with AR technology , I used Vuforia Engine in Unity to represent the reactions
between some chemical elements like (Ca,Na,Au,Sr,H2,O2,Al) , Also I added flame test experiment to help students to understand the difference between
chemical salts.
